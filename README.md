# Gigabyte GA-Z77X DSDT Patch

Support files for running macOS 10.11+ on Gigabyte 7 Series motherboards.

This is a WIP branch for macOS Sierra. Support for other boards will be re-added soon.

These support files can help you configure the post-installation process on Gigabyte 7 Series motherboards. The current repository uses custom SSDTs for each motherboard along with the GA-Z77X.sh post-installation script to create a working macOS installation.

### Usage

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/theracermaster/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-DSDT-Patch --branch sierra
```
```
cd Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-DSDT-Patch
```
```
./GA-Z77X.sh --install
```

### Supported Motherboards
Currently, the following motherboards are supported by the GA-Z77X.sh script:
 - GA-Z77X-D3H
 - GA-Z77X-UD3H
 - GA-Z77X-UD5H (-WB WIFI)
 - GA-Z77X-UP5 TH

### Issue Reporting
If you run into an issue while running the GA-Z77X.sh post-installation script or have an issue with the custom SSDTs, please report it on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/theracermaster/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-DSDT-Patch/issues).
